Adds a toolbar button that allow you to stash (store) and restore tabs and
windows as named groups.

Why?
====

I work by creating a window for each bug and keeping related tabs within that
window.  Because I tend to have multiple windows open at once
tabgroups/panorama doesn't work well for me.

Unfortunately there's a noticeable performance impact for keeping a large number
of windows open, so I started bookmarking all tabs and closing windows.

This addon automates that process, providing the ability to switch between
projects without the overhead of keeping a large number of windows and tabs
open.
